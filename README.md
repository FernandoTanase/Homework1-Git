# Tower of the Sorcerer
 Tower of the Sorcerer is a retro-style puzzle RPG released in 1996 as a freeware game for Windows. It
combines dungeon-crawling elements with intricate puzzles, set in a vertical, multi-level tower controlled by
an evil sorcerer. Players take on the role of a hero ascending the tower, battling monsters, collecting keys,
and managing resources such as health and attack points to progress through increasingly difficult floors.
The game is renowned for its strategic depth, requiring careful planning and experimentation to determine
the optimal path to victory. Its simple yet challenging gameplay inspired many subsequent games in the
genre.
